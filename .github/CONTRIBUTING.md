### What to expect next

We make every effort to perform an initial review of all PRs within 1 business day.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](#git-commit-messages).

Work in Progress pull request are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocked you.
